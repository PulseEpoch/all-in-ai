# All-in-AI: AI Model Practice Project

This project serves as a practice repository for understanding various AI models through simple code implementations. Each model is accompanied by minimal, explanatory code to demonstrate core concepts.

## Project Structure
- Each model has its own directory with implementation code
- Code includes comments explaining key concepts and algorithms
- Simple examples demonstrating model usage

## Models Included
- **linear_nn_fit-01**: Configurable linear neural network with optional sigmoid activation and dual linear layers
- **linear-classifier-02**: Basic linear classification with decision boundary visualization
- **mnist_classifier-03**: MNIST handwritten digit classification using neural networks

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the model directory (e.g., `cd linear_nn_fit-01`)
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the example: `python main.py`

## Requirements
- Python 3.12.0
- PyTorch 2.0.0+ and torchvision 0.20.0+ (see requirements.txt for details)
- NumPy, Matplotlib

## Contributing
Feel free to add implementations of other AI models with clear explanations.
